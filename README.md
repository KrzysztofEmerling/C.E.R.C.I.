#C.E.R.C.I - Chess Engine with Recursive Computation and Identity

C.E.R.C.I is a hybrid chess engine combining classical tree search methods (Alpha-Beta Pruning) with a modern transformer-based position evaluation approach. Its key feature is the ability to choose different personalities and playing styles, allowing users to customize the engine's behavior according to their preferences.

##Key Features

- Hybrid engine – combines classical move generation algorithms with intelligent position evaluation using a neural network.

- Adaptive playing styles – choose from different personality profiles, such as aggressive, positional, or defensive.

- AI-powered evaluation – transformer-based position assessment provides a more intuitive and strategic gameplay experience.

- Optimized computation – efficient use of Alpha-Beta Pruning.
